                <p>The United stated produced $171.7 billion in agricultural exports in 2021. </p>
                <p>According to the USDA, "Agriculture, food, and related industries contributed roughly $1.264 trillion to U.S. 
                    gross domestic product (GDP) in 2021, a 5.4-percent share. The output of America's farms contributed 
                    $164.7 billion of this sumâ€”about 0.7 percent of U.S. GDP. The overall contribution of agriculture to 
                    GDP is larger than 0.7 percent because sectors related to agriculture rely on agricultural inputs in 
                    order to contribute added value to the economy. Sectors related to agriculture include: food and beverage 
                    manufacturing; food and beverage stores; food services and eating/drinking places; textiles, apparel, and 
                    leather products; and forestry and fishing."</p>
